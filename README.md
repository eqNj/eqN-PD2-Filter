# Hello! Stay awhile and listen.

![Ground Loot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Charming.jpg)

These filters are up-to-date for Season 5 of Project Diablo 2!

You can find these loot filters either here (on GitHub) or through the Project Diablo 2 game launcher.

If you would like to contact me, find me in the official PD2 Discord with the name eqN.

If ever so inclined, you can support my efforts by donating on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=65YT5QXDEURW8&no_recurring=0&currency_code=USD).

The version known as 'eqN-All-In-One' in the game launcher includes all other versions of the filter, adjustable using the in-game settings.

The Relaxed version of this filter is the basis upon which all versions of this filter derive. It is generally less strict than other filters in the launcher but still focused on only showing potentially useful items. It is especially focused on optimizations as you level and slightly more lenient in the endgame by comparison. All versions of this filter share the same optimized leveling experience before reaching character level 75.

This filter doesn't try to make all the decisions for you. You will see things that you may or may not be inclined to pick up, but it is always reasonable why you're seeing these items if you understand the nuances of itemization in Diablo 2.

## Features

![Staff Mods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Staffmoody.jpg)

All non-magic (white) items with a relevant amount of plus skills that drop will show those skills in their name, making them easily identifiable at a glance.

All non-magic body armors will show their base defense range (in their description) to allow you to know if the item has a "good roll" in this way.

![Unsocketed Armor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Armor.jpg)

All weapons, when relevant, will show their Base Speed (-60 to 20) and Added Range (0 to +4) to make calculating IAS and comparing item bases quicker and easier.

All unsocketed, but socketable, items of any kind will show their potential maximum sockets (in their description), accounting for rarity, item level, and corruption. 

If an item is non-magic it will show its maximum potential sockets possible through the Larzuk quest or Cube socket recipe. 

If an item is rare, crafted, set, or unique it will show its maximum potential sockets through corruption specifically. 

If an item is rare, crafted, set, or unique and corrupted it will then only show its maximum potential sockets through use of a Larzuk's Puzzlebox specifically.

Once an item is socketed in any fashion the maximum potential socket information will be removed from the item's description.

![Crafting Ring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Craft.jpg)

All items will show any recipes possible, as applicable. They will use a color-coded symbol (@) matching their respective perfect gem color within the recipe, as seen above.

These recipes will show up once relevant as your character progresses, to help ease new players into this information. I.E.: Non-magic items will show their socketing recipe, if not of superior quality. Magic items will show all possible crafting recipes. Rare, crafted, set, and unique items will show possible upgrade recipes if any are available.

Specifically, socketing recipes will show at item level 21+ (or earlier on any +3 skills items). Upgrading recipes will show at item level 13+. Crafting recipes will show at item level 51+ (as a resulting craft item level of 51 is when you can guarantee at least 3 additional affixes).

![Upgrade Weapon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Upgrade.jpg)

All unique and set items always show in any of these filters, however only certain mid-to-high tier unique and set items will notify depending on which of the filter versions you choose. All runes will always show and notify on every filter version. Flawless gems always show and Perfect gems will always notify in all filter versions.

All elite tier non-magic (white) items are set to always show at higher levels, with a small exception only for class items that lack +3 to a useful skill. (Relaxed Filter)

Four socket, ethereal polearm/spear weapons of all tiers, for use with the Insight runeword on lower level characters, will show at all levels. (Relaxed Filter)

All rare items will still show at all levels. This includes all class items (wands, orbs, helms, scepters/maces, staves, claws) and any rare bows or crossbows of all tiers aswell. (Relaxed Filter)

Select magic items from all tiers, those that are best for crafting, will show, and they will be indicated by two gray asterisks, one on each side. High item level magic amulets will, once identified, show the exact character level best for crafting them to ensure +2 skills rolls are possible. (All Filter Versions)

Any class items with +3 to at least one of any useful skill will always show, regardless of item tier (unless a staff, due to tier-scaling cast speed favoring exceptional/elite items), as well as any elite class items that could be used for runewords. (All Filter Versions)

The following items will have added descriptions when they appear to be good for LLD (Low Level Dueling) or for high level PvE, and/or are in a state in which corruption would potentially yield a good LLD item: Charms, Jewels (Magic and Rare), certain Magic class item & weapon bases (ideal for crafting or usage as is), Rare and Crafted weapons and class items, and certain Unique and Set items popular for LLD. The following runeword bases specifically for LLD will show at all levels: 10%+ ED Naga, Lance, or Divine Scepter (for use with the Honor or Insight runewords). +3 Blade Fury (ethereal) and +3 Dragon Talon (non-ethereal) exceptional claws (for use with the Pattern or Malice runewords). (All Filter Versions)

Descriptions have been added to almost every quest item and/or utility item in the game. These descriptions are either lore tidbits or famous quotes throughout history befitting the items. (All Filter Versions)

![A Lot Of Drops](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Drops.jpg)

###### Read the "Changelog" further below for more details on the filters' features. (Relative to the above, using the Relaxed filter as the assumed baseline.) 

## Versions 

##### Relaxed - Ideal for early ladder where almost anything can be an upgrade and low tier items can be valuable. Also good for "Solo Self Found" / singleplayer, hardcore, and early ladder crafters. This filter will show you if anything usable, even into the late game, would drop for any class. Period. The Relaxed filter is for those used to life without one. Those of us who like quality of life improvements but don't want potentially useful items hidden from them. This is the base filter upon which the following two versions are designed.

##### Strict - Ideal for well geared characters and those who wish to only see more generally useful items and perfer magic class items specifically be for their current character's class. This filter still shows you all of niche runeword bases and the best general crafting bases from the Relaxed version, including those specifically useful for LLD. Crafting bases shown become specialized at character level 80. This filter finds a happy medium between the Relaxed and SuperStrict filter. 

##### SuperStrict - Ideal for those who partake in high speed mapping, either solo or especially in groups. Tailored to only show non-set/unique armors or weapons that have a high value in trading. This filter is useful for those who regularly run high density maps and dungeons and are mostly only looking for items with the highest trade value. 
 
###### The differences between these filters, relative to the Relaxed filter as a baseline, are further described below. All of these filters share the same leveling experience prior to character level 75.

## 'Relaxed' / 'Strict' / 'SuperStrict' Filter Differences

### The 'Strict' filter has the following changes (after character level 75):

Four socket, ethereal polearm/spear weapons of normal and exceptional tiers are hidden. (Elite tier will still show.)

Non-magic elite items are sometimes hidden, unless specifically useful for runewords or if they have +3 to a valuable skill.

Normal and exceptional magic items are hidden unless specifically great for crafting for your class or nearly impossible to shop and useful for LLD crafting.

Most exceptional and elite magic non-class items for crafting, except for elite chest armors, are hidden once you reach character level 80.

Normal, exceptional, and elite rare weapons are hidden, unless ethereal, a bow/crossbow, and/or a class item.

Only high/mid-value unique and set items will notify on drop, but all unique and set items will still always show on the ground.

Rare bolts and magic bolts and arrows are hidden, however Amazons will still see rare bolts and magic arrows.

Magic rings and amulets are hidden, unless item level 86+ rings or item level 90+ amulets.


### The 'SuperStrict' filter has the following changes (after character level 75):

Four socket, ethereal polearm/spear weapons of normal and exceptional tiers are hidden. (Elite tier will still show.)

Non-magic items are almost all hidden, unless highly sought after bases for runewords (mostly requiring 8%+ ED) or if they have +3 to a valuable skill.

Normal, exceptional, and elite magic items are hidden unless ethereal weapons for crafting and/or specifically for the class you are playing.

Normal, exceptional, and elite rare items are hidden, unless an ethereal weapon, an amazon bow, a class helm, necro shield, gloves, boots, belts, rings, amulets, circlets, or arrows.

Only high-value unique and set items will notify on drop, but all unique and set items will still always show on the ground.

Rare bolts are hidden and magic bolts and arrows are hidden.

Non-magic (for imbuing) and magic circlets of all kinds are hidden.

Regular Rejuvination Potions (not Full) and Greater Mana Potions (not Super) are hidden.

Magic rings and amulets are hidden.

Magic large charms are hidden.

# Changelog:

## 1.0.0 - (Season 1)

Replaced the word 'Superior' on superior items with an orange + at the front of item names.

All presently showing superior items with Enhanced Defense or Enhanced Damage will show their percentage at all stages of the game.

Stack sizes now only show on item names for stacks > 1.

All possible runewords or the method of socketing will show in the description on applicable items at all times, if that item is seen by your character.

Added a description to unsocketed superior items advising they can be socketed only through Larzuk or Corruption.

Ethereal items will be tagged with [e] at the front of their names.

More magic items worth crafting now show up with a gray asterisk crafting base indication, and select few with added alerts.

Reduced the threshold for Enhanced Damage and Increased Resistance paladin shields to be shown.  

Paladin shields with any All Resistance or high Enhanced Damage will now show such ([#r] or [ed]) behind their names instead of in front.  

Potion names have been greatly shrunk across the board, and greater mana potions will still show in Hell.

Restructured item name formatting to help reduce visual clutter.  

Shortened skill names shown on dropped white class items to help reduce visual clutter.  

Item level 88+ amulets will tell you what level to craft them at for +2 class skills.  

All circlets of all tiers will always show, except if they are lower tier, white, and ethereal and/or socketed (unusable for imbuing).  

All circlets will show the ideal level to imbue them for +2 to class skills in their description.  

All Runes of all tiers, all uniques, and any decent set items will continue to alert you on drop at all levels.    

Corrected and reduced any incorrect or unnecessary vocabulary in item descriptions and improved the overall visual experience.  

Re-optimized the filter's structure to make editing easier and cut back on some redundancies.

## 1.1.0 - (Season 2)

Multi-line item names are impossible as of 3/29/21.

All uniques and runes previously using multi-line item names will look otherwise identical and still use spacing to increase their name size.

Plus skills on items will still be listed, though shortened, in dark green text next to applicable item names. (As seen above, in the 'Features' section.)

Items with only plus 1 to a skill will not show such in their names after character level 30. These items will still show up on the ground as normal, until character level 80+ where any non-elite bases are required to have plus 3 to atleast one useful skill to show.

I find this the easiest way to maintain item plus skill legibility at a glance, though I am open to any suggestions on how to improve this new system.

All elite items will continue to show past level 80 as normal.

Details from 'The Arreat Summit' about Base Defense ranges and maximum potential sockets (dynamic with item level) have been added to all item descriptions where possible/applicable. The max sockets shown on Unique, Crafted, Set, and Rare items will be the maximum amount possible through a corruption. As soon as an item has any sockets it will stop showing the max sockets that were possible.

(Big thanks to TheIrateSeagoer for his work on the Arreat Summit details!)

Crafting recipes will now only show on identified magic items with item level 51 or higher. 

Worth note: when crafting, base item level 51+ and character level 51+ ensures a minimum of three additional affixes on the resulting item.

All unidentified magic items marked as ideal for crafting (two gray asterisks, one on each side) do so based on when they meet the item level (assuming same character level or higher) for either 4 guaranteed additional affixes (level 71) and/or in rare cases when their most relevant affixes become available before then.

Replaced the word 'Inferior' (Crude, Cracked, etc.) on inferior items with a blue - sign at the front of item names. 

(Inferior items are only viewable before level 30 and only if they have + to skills.)

Further refined the leveling experience to continually show useful items while de-cluttering across a gradient of character progression at all stages.

Added quest item lore and quotes.

## 1.2.0 - (Season 3)

Created and now maintain a more strict, seperate version of my filter. You can see the differences listed above.

Made it so ALL rares will now show, regardless of tier, at ALL levels. (Relaxed Filter Only)

If this is deemed excessive I will cut it down to how it was previously (showing select ethereal rare weapons and/or ideal rare armors).

Changed the Perfect Gem icon from "O" to "@" to help further distinguish it.

Changed the Flawless Gem icon from "O" to "*" to help further distinguish it.

Changed the Gem icon for all gems of lower tiers from "*" to ":" to further distinguish them.

Made it so Large Charms (just as Small and Grand did priorly) will now notify on drop.

Added detailed information to charm names for Large Charms with new % Damage stats.

Added all new uniques added to the game for Season 3 as particularly highlighted drops.

Made it so magic (for crafting) and non-magic (with druid plus skills) clubs of all tiers will always show on drop.

Added new Vampiric and Bountiful crafting recipes to magic item descriptions.

Added the new Pandemonium Talisman.

Some jewels that are good for LLD (Low Level Dueling) will indicate such once identified.

Made it so "Base Defense: X-X" and "Max Sockets: X" are now on separate lines in item descriptions.

Tidied up and added all new/changed runewords to applicable socketed item types.

Narrowed down some parameters to show non-magic staves at higher levels now due to staves having a scaling implicit cast speed bonus based upon tier.

## 1.3.0 - (Season 4)

Added Base Speed value to weapons.

Made all Base Defense, Base Speed, and Max Socket info in descriptions white.  

By popular demand: There is now a 'SuperStrict' version of the filter. You can read more about it above, in the 'Versions' section.

Added more shopping highlights for valuable magic items. 

Continued improvements and refinement of items that show up unidentified with two gray asterisks (denoting useful crafting bases).

Added notificationa for rare quivers. Magic quivers will always show, but not notify.

Added special notifications for all of the new Uber Rathma uniques.

Continued maintenance of new/improved unique item notifications and tiering therein. (Most relevant for the strict filter.)

Ensured any non-magic wands or necro shields with the new Summon Skeleton Archer skill on them will show such in their name (SkArc).

Updated the "Max Sockets" info on countless items, as 2 handed weapons can once again get up to 4 sockets from Puzzlebox, or up to 6 sockets from Corruption. 

Ensured all 'potential runewords' listed in non-magic, socketed item descriptions are accurate with Season 4 update.

Ensured any and all newly useful runeword bases are always showing and sometimes notifying. (4 socket, ethereal elite shields, 3 socket ethereal class or elite helms, 5 socket elite amazon bows, etc.)

Updated the list of +skills needed on a non-magic class item for it to show, overall making them generally much more inclusive in the endgame.

Added notes to magic, rare, and crafted items that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading and corruption.

Added notes to magic and rare jewels that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading.

Added notes to unique and set items that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading and corruption.

Added notes to charms that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading.

Big thanks to Hastmannen for their help with all the Low Level Dueling information. You can find Hastmannen's LLD guides for PD2 on Reddit!

## 1.4.0 - (Season 5)

Created a new "default" version of the filter, available in the launcher, simply with the name "eqN-All-In-One". This filter uses the new "filter level" settings available as of Season 5 to essentially combine the different strictness levels I've made publicly available of my filter in to a single filter.

Visually remastered nearly every aspect of item drops and/or descriptons to include even more lore tidbits, famous quotes, and pertinent item information with concise and clean aesthetics and grammar.

Added detailed descriptions and drop notifications/aesthetics for all of the new 'recipe' items in Season 5: Larzuk's Puzzlepiece, Lilith's Mirror, and Vial of Lightsong.

Added mention of all of the new runewords in Season 5 to applicable bases, including both the new D2:R and PD2 exclusive runewords. Made sure all relevant item bases for use with these runewords will always show on drop, relative to their usefulness as you progress.

Ensured all new unique items added to the game in Season 5 will notify on drop and have a specialize aesthetic.

Adjusted it so recipes on items will not show if the item is equipped and/or in a shopping window.

Updated the recipes on Uber Rathma ingredients as they no longer require Prime Evil Soul(s).

Updated potion aesthetic to be more unique and slightly easier to pick up. Also thoroughly improved what potions show at what point of progress as you level to help reduce visual clutter.

A massive amount of tweaks have been added to the LLD item tags introduced last season to refine them to always show the (LLD) tag on items worth keeping for you LLD characters without introducing excessive visuals and/or notifications.

Made it so skill grand charms will use their original prefix names for their aesthetic coloration.
