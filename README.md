# Hello! Stay awhile and listen.

![Den](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Header.jpg)

These filters are up-to-date for Season 8 of Project Diablo 2!

You can find these loot filters either here (on GitHub) or through the Project Diablo 2 game launcher.

If you would like to contact me, find me in the official PD2 Discord with the name eqN.

If ever so inclined, you can support my efforts by donating on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=65YT5QXDEURW8&no_recurring=0&currency_code=USD).

The version known as 'eqN-All-In-One' in the game launcher includes all other past versions of the filter, adjustable using the in-game settings for "filter level". 

The version known as 'eqN-Potionless' is the same as 'eqN-All-In-One', however it hides Super/Large Health and Mana potions after character level 75 at all filter levels.

The version known as 'eqN-Specialized-LLD' is the same as 'eqN-All-In-One', however it hides Super/Large Health and Mana potions after character level 75 at filter levels above 'Relaxed' and it shows details for LLD crafting on applicable base items on the 'ShowRecipes' filter level.

Currently, these filters are stylized in such a way as to require the use of the new HD text introduced with Season 7 of Project Diablo 2.

To those interested: these filters are specially designed to be 100% functional with the in-game filter level setting 'Show All Items' and will apply all filter aesthetic (item name and description) effects to every item.

![Filter Levels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/FiltLevel.jpg)

#### FYI: You can toggle the filter strictness level, or switch to the 'ShowRecipes' filter level, by holding CTRL + clicking on the PD2 in-game 'Settings' button, then adjusting your filter level under the 'Item' tab. These filters use this functionality heavily.

## Brief Summary

When using any filter level the following applies. All flawless and perfect gems always show. All runes always show. All charms always show. Unique and set items always show. Ethereal rare, magic, or elite non-magic (white) items always show. All non-magic (white) items with +3 to a useful skill always show. All elite non-magic superior items with 10%+ ED always show.

When using the default, 'Relaxed', filter level the above and the following apply. All elite non-magic (white) items always show. All rare items always show. All useful magic crafting bases always show. 

The 'Relaxed' level of this filter is the basis upon which all levels of this filter derive. It is generally less strict than other filters in the launcher but still focused on only showing potentially useful items. All levels of this filter share an identical, highly optimized leveling experience before reaching character level 75. 

#### For more details about all of the different filter levels please read the [levels](https://github.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter#levels) section of this readme.

This filter doesn't try to make all the decisions for you. It is highly focused on optimizations as you level and slightly more lenient in the endgame by comparison. You will occasionally see things that you may not be inclined to pick up, but it is always reasonable why you're seeing these items if you understand the nuances of itemization in Diablo 2.

## Features

![Staff Mods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Staffmods.jpg)

All non-magic (white) items with a relevant amount of plus skills that drop will show those skills in their name, making them easily identifiable at a glance.

All non-magic (white) body armors and helmets will show their base defense range (in their description) to allow you to know if the item has a "good roll" in this way.

![Based](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/BaseDefense.jpg)

All weapons, when relevant, will show their Base Speed (-60 to 20) and Added Range (0 to +4) to make calculating IAS and comparing item bases quicker and easier.

All unsocketed, but socketable, items of any kind will show their potential maximum sockets (in their description), accounting for rarity, item level, and corruption. 

If an item is non-magic (white) and unsocketed it will show its maximum potential sockets possible through the Larzuk quest or Cube socket recipe. 

If an item is non-magic (white) and socketed it will show its possible runewords by name on all filter levels and will include the runes in the approrpriate order on the 'ShowRecipes' filter level. 

![Runewords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Runes.jpg)

If an item is magic, rare, crafted, set, or unique it will show its maximum potential sockets through corruption specifically. 

If an item is magic, rare, crafted, set, or unique and corrupted it will then only show its maximum potential sockets through use of a Larzuk's Puzzlepiece / Puzzlebox specifically.

Once an item is socketed in any fashion the maximum potential socket information will be removed from the item's description.

![Crafting Ring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Crafting.jpg)

All items will show recipes possible, as applicable, when using the 'ShowRecipes' filter level. They will use a color-coded symbol (@) matching their respective perfect gem color within the recipe, as seen above.

Recipes will begin to be available once relevant as your character progresses or when using the appropriate filter level. I.E.: Non-magic (white) items will show their socketing recipe. Magic items and perfect gems will show crafting recipes on the 'ShowRecipes' filter level. Rare, crafted, set, and unique items will show possible upgrade recipes if any are available.

Specifically, socketing recipes will show at item level 21+ (or earlier on any +3 skills items) on all filter levels. Upgrading recipes will show at item level 13+ and crafting recipes will show at all item levels (when on the 'ShowRecipes' filter level).

![Upgrading Weapon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Upgrading.jpg)

All unique and set items always show in any of these filters. Uniques will always notify on the Relaxed filter level, however only certain mid-to-high tier unique and set items will notify on the more strict filter levels. All runes will always show and notify on every filter level. Flawless gems always show and perfect gems will always notify in all filter levels.

![A Lot Of Drops](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eqNj/eqN-PD2-Filter/Filter-Sub/Loot.jpg)

All elite tier non-magic (white) items are set to always show at higher levels, with a small exception only for class items that lack +3 to a useful skill. (Relaxed filter level)

Four socket, ethereal polearm/spear weapons of all tiers, for use with the Insight runeword on lower level characters, will show at all levels. (Relaxed filter level)

All rare items will still show at all levels. This includes all class items (wands, orbs, helms, scepters/maces, staves, claws) and any rare bows or crossbows of all tiers aswell. (Relaxed filter level)

Select magic and rare items from all tiers, those that are best for crafting based on your character level or general rarity, will always show, and they will be indicated by two teal dots, one on each side, of their unidentified name. (All filter levels)

Any class items with +3 to at least one of any useful skill will always show, regardless of item tier (unless a staff, due to tier-scaling cast speed favoring exceptional/elite items), as well as any elite class items that could be used for runewords. (All filter levels)

The following items will have added descriptions when they appear to be good for LLD (Low Level Dueling) or for high level PvE, and/or are in a state in which corruption would potentially yield a good LLD item: Charms, Jewels (Magic and Rare), certain Magic class item & weapon bases (ideal for crafting or usage as is), Rare and Crafted weapons, chest armors, shields, and class items, and certain Unique and Set items popular for LLD.

Descriptions have been added to almost every quest item and/or utility item in the game. These descriptions are either lore tidbits or famous quotes throughout history befitting the items. (All filter levels)

###### Read the "Changelog" further below for more details on the filters' features. (Relative to the above, using the Relaxed filter level as the assumed baseline.) 

## Levels 

##### Relaxed - Ideal for early ladder where almost anything can be an upgrade and low tier items can be valuable. Also good for "Solo Self Found" / singleplayer, hardcore, and early ladder crafting. This filter level will show you if anything usable, even into the late game, would drop for any class. Period. The Relaxed filter level is for those used to life without one. Those of us who like quality of life improvements but don't want potentially useful items hidden from them. This is the base filter level upon which the following two levels are designed.

##### Medium - Ideal for well geared characters and those who wish to only see more generally useful items. This filter level is also good for those who perfer magic class items that show mostly only be for their current character's class. This filter level still shows you all of the niche runeword bases and the best general crafting bases from the Relaxed level. Crafting bases shown become class specialized at character level 80. This filter level finds a happy 'medium' between the Relaxed and Strict filter levels. 

##### Strict - Ideal for those who partake in high speed mapping, either solo or especially in groups. Tailored to only show non-set/unique armors or weapons when they are likely to have a reasonably high value in trading. Even at this level, all unique and set items will still show. Crafting bases shown are only those which are highly sought after. This filter level is useful for those who regularly run high density maps and dungeons and are mostly only looking for items that are easy to trade. 

##### StrictLLD - This is essentially a copy of the Strict filter level, however it will continue to show & sometimes notify when a LLD crafting base drops. This level is designed for late ladder and/or targeted LLD item farming. LLD crafting bases are marked with purple dots.

##### ShowRecipes - This filter level shows all crafting and upgrading recipes on any applicable items. The crafting recipes can be found on magic items and on perfect gems. The upgrade recipes include information about the requirements for upgraded items. This level will also show all runes necessary for runewords on any socketed non-magic (white) items. This level is not recommended for use while item finding as it can be a bit visually noisy. Though, if item finding with this filter level it will never hide anything important. This filter level uses Strict as a baseline but it still shows all LLD crafting bases, as well as any and all non-magic (white) items that would otherwise show on the Relaxed filter. This filter level will show the recommended level for LLD crafting on most LLD-applicable crafting bases when using the 'eqN-Specialized-LLD' filter specifically.

###### The differences between these filter levels, relative to the Relaxed filter level as a baseline, are further described below. All of these filter levels share the same leveling experience prior to character level 75.

## 'Relaxed' / 'Medium' / 'Strict' Filter Level Differences

### The 'Medium' filter level has the following changes (after character level 75):

Gold piles less than 1600 are hidden.

Flawless gems no longer notify. (Perfect gems still do.)

Four socket, ethereal polearm/spear weapons of normal and exceptional tiers are hidden. (Elite tier will still show.)

Non-magic (white) elite items are sometimes hidden, unless specifically useful for runewords or if they have +3 to a valuable skill.

Normal and exceptional magic items are hidden unless they are ethereal or specifically great for crafting for your class and/or nearly impossible to shop and useful for LLD crafting.

Most exceptional and elite magic non-class items for crafting, except for elite chest armors, are hidden once you reach character level 80.

### The 'Strict' filter level has the following changes (after character level 75):

Gold piles less than 3000 are hidden.

Flawless gems no longer notify. (Perfect gems still do.)

Four socket, ethereal polearm/spear weapons of normal and exceptional tiers are hidden. (Elite tier will still show.)

Non-magic (white) items are almost all hidden, unless highly sought after bases for runewords (mostly requiring 5%+ ED) or if they have +3 to a valuable skill.

Normal, exceptional, and elite magic items are hidden unless ethereal items for crafting and/or specifically useful for the class you are playing.

Normal, exceptional, and elite rare items are hidden, unless an ethereal weapon, an amazon bow, a class helm, necro shield, gloves, boots, belts, rings, amulets, circlets, or arrows.

Only high-value unique and set items will notify on drop, but all unique and set items will still always show on the ground.

Magic arrows are hidden for all classes. Rare bolts are hidden for all classes except Amazons. Rare arrows will still show.

Non-magic (for imbuing) and magic circlets of all kinds are hidden.

# Changelog:

## 1.0.0 - (Season 1)

Replaced the word 'Superior' on superior items with an orange + at the front of item names.

All presently showing superior items with Enhanced Defense or Enhanced Damage will show their percentage at all stages of the game.

Stack sizes now only show on item names for stacks > 1.

All possible runewords or the method of socketing will show in the description on applicable items at all times, if that item is seen by your character.

Added a description to unsocketed superior items advising they can be socketed only through Larzuk or Corruption.

Ethereal items will be tagged with [e] at the front of their names.

More magic items worth crafting now show up with a teal dot crafting base indication, and select few with added alerts.

Reduced the threshold for Enhanced Damage and Increased Resistance paladin shields to be shown.  

Paladin shields with any All Resistance or Enhanced Damage will now show such ([#r] or [#ed]) behind their names instead of in front.  

Potion names have been greatly shrunk across the board, and greater mana potions will still show in Hell.

Restructured item name formatting to help reduce visual clutter.  

Shortened skill names shown on dropped white class items to help reduce visual clutter.  

Item level 88+ amulets will tell you what level to craft them at for +2 class skills.  

All circlets of all tiers will always show, except if they are lower tier, white, and ethereal and/or socketed (unusable for imbuing).  

All circlets will show the ideal level to imbue them for +2 to class skills in their description.  

All Runes of all tiers, all uniques, and any decent set items will continue to alert you on drop at all levels.    

Corrected and reduced any incorrect or unnecessary vocabulary in item descriptions and improved the overall visual experience.  

Re-optimized the filter's structure to make editing easier and cut back on some redundancies.

## 1.1.0 - (Season 2)

Multi-line item names are impossible as of 3/29/21.

All uniques and runes previously using multi-line item names will look otherwise identical and still use spacing to increase their name size.

Plus skills on items will still be listed, though shortened, in dark green text next to applicable item names. (As seen above, in the 'Features' section.)

Items with only plus 1 to a skill will not show such in their names after character level 20. These items will still show up on the ground as normal, until character level 80+ where any non-elite bases are required to have plus 3 to atleast one useful skill to show.

I find this the easiest way to maintain item plus skill legibility at a glance, though I am open to any suggestions on how to improve this new system.

All elite items will continue to show past level 80 as normal.

Details from 'The Arreat Summit' about Base Defense ranges and maximum potential sockets (dynamic with item level) have been added to all item descriptions where possible/applicable. The max sockets shown on Unique, Crafted, Set, and Rare items will be the maximum amount possible through a corruption. As soon as an item has any sockets it will stop showing the max sockets that were possible.

(Big thanks to TheIrateSeagoer for his work on the Arreat Summit details!)

Worth note: when crafting, base item level 51+ and character level 51+ ensures a minimum of three additional affixes on the resulting item.

All unidentified magic items marked as ideal for crafting (two teal dots, one on each side) do so based on when they meet the item level (assuming same character level or higher) for either 4 guaranteed additional affixes (level 71) and/or in rare cases when their most relevant affixes become available before then.

Replaced the word 'Inferior' (Crude, Cracked, etc.) on inferior items with a blue - sign at the front of item names. 

(Inferior items are normally only viewable before level 15 and only if they have + to skills.)

Further refined the leveling experience to continually show useful items while de-cluttering across a gradient of character progression at all stages.

Added quest item lore and quotes.

## 1.2.0 - (Season 3)

Created and now maintain a more strict, seperate level of my filter. You can see the differences listed above.

Made it so ALL rares will now show, regardless of tier, at ALL levels. (Relaxed Filter Only)

If this is deemed excessive I will cut it down to how it was previously (showing select ethereal rare weapons and/or ideal rare armors).

Made it so Large Charms (just as Small and Grand did priorly) will now notify on drop.

Added detailed information to charm names for Large Charms with new % Damage stats.

Added all new uniques added to the game for Season 3 as particularly highlighted drops.

Made it so magic (for crafting) and non-magic (with druid plus skills) clubs of all tiers will show on drop.

Added new Vampiric and Bountiful crafting recipes to magic item descriptions.

Added the new Pandemonium Talisman.

Some jewels that are good for LLD (Low Level Dueling) will indicate such once identified.

Made it so "Base Defense: X-X" and "Max Sockets: X" are now on separate lines in item descriptions.

Tidied up and added all new/changed runewords to applicable socketed item types.

Narrowed down some parameters to show non-magic staves at higher levels now due to staves having a scaling implicit cast speed bonus based upon tier.

## 1.3.0 - (Season 4)

Added Base Speed value to weapons.

Made all Base Defense, Base Speed, and Max Socket info in descriptions white.  

By popular demand: There is now a 'Strict' level of the filter. You can read more about it above, in the 'Levels' section.

Added more shopping highlights for valuable magic items. 

Continued improvements and refinement of items that show up unidentified with two teal dots (denoting useful crafting bases).

Added notificationa for rare quivers. Magic quivers will always show, but not notify.

Added special notifications for all of the new Uber Rathma uniques.

Continued maintenance of new/improved unique item notifications and tiering therein. (Most relevant for the Medium filter.)

Ensured any non-magic wands or necro shields with the new Summon Skeleton Archer skill on them will show such in their name (SkArc).

Updated the "Max Sockets" info on countless items, as 2 handed weapons can once again get up to 4 sockets from Puzzlebox, or up to 6 sockets from Corruption. 

Ensured all 'potential runewords' listed in non-magic, socketed item descriptions are accurate with Season 4 update.

Ensured any and all newly useful runeword bases are always showing and sometimes notifying. (4 socket, ethereal elite shields, 3 socket ethereal class or elite helms, 5 socket elite amazon bows, etc.)

Updated the list of +skills needed on a non-magic class item for it to show, overall making them generally much more inclusive in the endgame.

Added notes to magic, rare, and crafted items that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading and corruption.

Added notes to magic and rare jewels that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading.

Added notes to unique and set items that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading and corruption.

Added notes to charms that are good for Low Level Dueling to encourage trading.

Big thanks to Hastmannen for their help with all the Low Level Dueling information. You can find Hastmannen's LLD guides for PD2 on Reddit!

## 1.4.0 - (Season 5)

Created a new "default" version of the filter, available in the launcher, simply with the name "eqN-All-In-One". All of my filters use the new "filter level" settings available as of Season 5 to essentially combine the different strictness levels I've made publicly available of my filter in to a single filter. All filter versions are designed to fully accommodate "filter level 0/Show All Items".

Renamed the old 'Strict' filter level to 'Medium'.

Added a new 'StrictLLD' filter level that uses the 'late season' / 'high speed mapping' strictness of the Strict filter level while still showing and notifying for all non-shoppable LLD crafting bases that drop.

Added a new 'ShowRecipes' filter level that shows all crafting and upgrading recipes that previously would always show on items in your stash, inventory, or when equipped. These recipes show on all magic items and on perfect gems. These recipes are now hidden on all other filter levels. This filter level also shows the runes necessary for runewords on runeword bases in their sequential order of necessary socketing.

Socketing recipes will still show at all filter levels.

Visually remastered nearly every aspect of item drop names and/or descriptons to include even more lore tidbits, famous quotes, and pertinent item information with concise and clean aesthetics and grammar.

Crafting, upgrading, and socketing recipes will no longer show on items while they are in a vendor's inventory (all filter levels) to help make items worth shopping for easier to see at a glance.

Gold that is hidden is no longer able to be auto-looted as of Season 5. I've adopted the scaling gold drop system designed by BetweenWalls as a solution to allow much more gold to be seen and thus auto-looted. This scaling applies at all levels on the Relaxed filter. Currently, at level 75+, gold piles less than 1600 are hidden on the Medium filter level and less than 3000 are hidden on the Strict & StrictLLD filter levels.

Added a new "Potionless" filter version to the launcher, "eqN-Potionless", which functions identically to "eqN-All-In-One" except it hides Super Potions after character level 75. (Intended for characters who do not need them.)

Added a new "Specialized LLD" filter version to the launcher, "eqN-Specialized-LLD", which functions identically to "eqN-All-In-One" except it hides Super Potions after character level 75 on Medium or higher strictness. This filter level also adds details about ideal character levels to craft with to LLD crafting bases.

Added detailed descriptions and drop notifications/aesthetics for all of the new 'recipe' items in Season 5: Larzuk's Puzzlepiece, Lilith's Mirror, and Vial of Lightsong.

Added mention of all of the new runewords in Season 5 to applicable bases, including both the new D2:R and PD2 exclusive runewords. Made sure all relevant item bases for use with these runewords will always show on drop, relative to their usefulness as you progress.

Added new discrete visual versions of every potion that immensely help declutter, particularly when using filter level 0.

Added new description lines to hundreds of potentially useful jewel affixes and/or affix combinations to help signify their usability and/or tradability at a glance after identification.

Added description lines to all of the new maps in Season 5 with their potential monster immunities.

Made it so items that gain +1 potential maximum sockets from being upgraded indicate this in their description(s) (unless doing so would make them unusable for low level dueling).

A corrupted Annihilus will now always have a red name and a corrupted Annihilus with the +1 All Skills corruption will have an orange + in front of it's red name. Useful for drop trading.

Thoroughly refined the unique items that notify on drop to further accomidate any possible niche use cases.

Thoroughly refined the runeword bases that show and/or notify on drop to further accomidate any possible niche use cases.

Ensured all new unique items added to the game in Season 5 will notify on drop and have a specialized aesthetic.

Adjusted the Enhanced Damage tag on Paladin shields to show the exact amount of enhanced damage in the item name.

When a map rolls an added monster type affix it will now tell what immunities those monsters have in the item description.

Updated the recipes on Uber Rathma ingredients as they no longer require Prime Evil Soul(s).

Updated potion aesthetic to be more unique and slightly easier to pick up. Also thoroughly improved what potions show at what point of progress as you level to help reduce visual clutter.

A massive amount of tweaks have been added to the LLD item tags introduced last season. These changes refine the item tags to always show the LLD tag on items worth keeping for your LLD characters without introducing excessive visuals and/or notifications.

Made it so all charms will use their original affix names (instead of the color coded names based on the affix modifiers, like other filters) to retain some of the original D2 aesthetic.

## 1.5.0 - (Season 6)

A massive amount of changes/improvements were made to the filter throughout the last half of Season 5, please read about them above.

Ensured all useful +3 runeword bases will show for improved skills this season (Inferno, Arctic Blast, Dragon Talon, etc).

Updated the descriptions for changed rune socketing effects for Jah, Ber, Ohm, Ist, and Dol runes.

Made sure ideal Wand runeword bases for the improved White runeword will notify on drop as a Necromancer. (They were already showing.)

Added pertinent information for the new runewords (Asylum and Shattered Wall) to applicable runeword bases. (This includes rune listing/order provided in the ShowRecipes filter level.)

Added new description lines for class skill and/or high ED armors and shields with other useful affixes. (Applicable for LLD and high level items.)

Added new existing runeword possibilites introduced this season to applicable runewords bases. (This includes rune listing/order provided in the ShowRecipes filter level.)

Reworked how and when rare and magic arrows and bolts show depending on filter level.

Updated map tiers and immunities in alignment with their rework this season.

Added monster immunity percentage to map immunity information.

Continued improvements on mid and high tier uniques with highlights.

Made it so small and large charms with the ideal affix level ranges for rerolling for LLD will be LLD highlighted on drop and have a description encouraging their rerolling (until they hit a reasonably desired roll).

Made it so ideal affix level (38) jewels for LLD rerolling are highlighted on drop and have a description encouraging their rerolling (until they hit a reasonably desired roll).

## 1.6.0 - (Season 7)

Renamed the SuperStrict filter level to Strict.

Refined the ShowRecipes filter level to ensure it always shows non-magic (white) item names that would show on the Relaxed filter level.

Refined the overall filter aesthetic with the new HD text in mind. This includes the use of new colors and characters.

Changed the asterisks on craftable item bases to dots for improved aesthetics on the improved graphics settings this season.

Currently, enabling the new HD text is mandatory to prevent question marks from appearing on certain item names.

Added the name of the currently selected filter level to the Horadric Cube's description.

Updated the descriptions for changed rune socketing effects for Ohm runes.

Improved name formatting and added descriptions for all the new items introduced in Season 7, including highlighting for unique map drops.

Ensured all runeword bases for every new and improved build always shows up.

Added new runeword possibility info to all applicable bases and ensured that any useful bases for those runewords continue to show up.

Improved "Upgraded Requirements", "Upgrade Recipe", and "LLD Armor/Shield" description implementations to be more inclusive.

Overhauled filter in-line formatting on non-magic items for consistency in editing.

Made is so equipped items no longer show recipes on the ShowRecipes filter level, as always intended, now that it has been fixed to not include the shared stash tabs. Non-equipped items still show recipes as intended.

Added LLD tags for good crafted/rare LLD rings and rare quivers.

Added a discription tag to magic, rare, and crafted weapons with an Amplify Damage proc.

Refined the descriptions on many existing items for congruence and legibility.

Added a red dot on corrupted item names when in the new unique map that drops corrupted items. Since confirming these corrupted items drop unidentified, all Rare unidentified items will always show on all filter levels when in this map.

Added monster resistance information for unique maps.

Added a note about adding difficulty tier to a Vision of Terror or a Voidstone when there is no difficulty tier yet added.

## 1.7.0 - (Season 8)

Added the newly introduced throwing potions of all elements, useful during leveling, to the filter with a discreet aesthetic to help minimalize visual clutter.

Added new leveling notifications (before level 75) for high defense Mage Plates, Grim Shields, and Grim Helmets as well as notifications on these (and all Elite) perfect Superior (15% ED) chest, shield, and helmet runeword bases at all levels. Elite weapons that were perfect Superior (15% ED) were already notifying, and as always all moderately useful runeword bases, Superior or having good Staffmods, were already showing and sometimes notifying.

Updated all relevant Staffmod information and applications for the new Paladin skill Holy Sword.

Updated the uber fight difficulty scaling instructions on relevant items for the new three tier system.

Updated the descriptions for existing map orbs, when necessary, and added descriptions for the new Infused map orbs.

Added all of the new runewords (and their runes, listed on the ShowRecipes filter level) introduced this season to applicable base items.

Removed the red corruption indicator in the Warlord of Blood unique map as all items now drop corrupted in the map.

Added a new description note for the filter version to keys when in the shop.

Added a new shop hunting highlight style that utilizes the fact that %NL% within identified item names is now usable.

Did a pass on all the Unique and Set items that have accenting based on their rarity and/or value and further organized them within the code for ease of editing.

Continued optimizations for use with the new HD text introduced last season.
