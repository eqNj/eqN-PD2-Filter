# Hello! Stay a while and listen.

If you would like to contact me, find me in the offical PD2 Discord with the name eqN.

I've created what is essentially a remastered version of Kryszard's Project Diablo 2 loot filter.
You can find his filter here:
https://github.com/Kryszard-POD/Kryszard-s-PD2-Loot-Filter

I have kept all of the core features intact and added several QoL features with much less strict but still very focused filtration as you level, especially end game.

All elite tier items are showing, even after level 80, with only small exceptions for either some class items that are of low +Skill values or weapons with a maximum of 2 sockets or less. Exceptional rares still show past level 80, as well as any rare class items (wands, orbs, helms, scepters, staves, claws) and bows of all tiers will always show as well. Select ethereal and/or magic weapons from all tiers, those that are best for crafting, will continue to show.
Ethereal merc weapons of all tiers, for Insight, show.

Any class items with +3 to at least one of any useful skill will now always show, regardless of item tier, as well as any elite class items that can be used for Rune Words.

The same high value items that were set to alert you on drop with Kryszard's filter will do so still with the same alerts.

This filter is for those of us used to life without one. For anyone who likes to see all the usable items that possibly drop, but without the clutter of vanilla Diablo 2 loot.

Grindy solo players or those seeking out less commonly used items for specialty builds may find this filter most useful. It will show you if anything remotely useful into the late game would drop for any class. Period.

I will also release a stricter alternative version of the filter, reminiscent of Kryszard's somewhat, for those interested.

# Changelog:

1.0.0 -

Re-optimized the filter's structure to make editing easier and cut back on some redundancies.

Replaced the word 'Superior' on superior items with an orange + sign. 

All presently showing superior items with Enhanced Defense or Enhanced Damage will show their percentage at all stages of the game.

All possible Rune Words, and the socketing recipe, will show in the description on applicable items, from all difficulties, at all times if seen by your character.

Added a description to unsocketed superior items advising they can be socketed only through Larzuk or Corruption.

Ethereal items will now be tagged with [e] at the front of their names.

Reduced the threshold for Enhanced Damage and Increased Resistance paladin shields to be shown.

Paladin shields with All Resistance will now show such [#r] behind their names instead of in front.

Potion names have been greatly shrunk across the board, and greater mana potions now still show in Hell.

Reduced spacing on some item name formatting to help reduce visual clutter.

Removed price tags from all items but identified rare items to help reduce visual clutter.

Shortened skill names shown on dropped white class items to help reduce visual clutter.

More magic items worth crafting now show up with the gray asterisk crafting base indication, and select few with added alerts.

Item level 88+ amulets will be marked [C] to indicate they're desired for crafting, and they will tell you what level to craft them at for +2 class skills.

All circlets of all tiers will always show, except if they are lower tier, white, and ethereal and/or socketed (unusable for imbuing).

All circlets will show the ideal level to imbue them for +2 to class skills in their description.

All Runes of all tiers, all uniques, and any decent set items will continue to alert you on drop after level 80.

Corrected and reduced any incorrect or unnecessary vocabulary in item descriptions and improved the overall visual experience.

Added the new Diablo Clone ultra rare uniques to the filter with the familiar alerts and enlarged names like other high value uniques.
